# Actifit Bot

This bot was built to perform voting on actifit posts, but also store and calculate actifit tokens, transactions and relevant posts into own Mongogb

The work in this bot has been implemented initially by @cryptouru, based on a fork of yabapmatt's community bot   https://github.com/MattyIce/communitybot

We have grown this code/bot to become a full working API for querying/transacting with actifit
